# 👋 Hi, I’m Cassandra,

Recent graduate of the Software Engineering Immsersive at General Assembly. I learned a bit of HTML and CSS on my own before commiting to a full time course back in August 2023. I'm currently refining the skills learned while at GA and will be starting a few passion projects as I enter the job search. 

## I practice code with:
+ JavaScript
+ React.js
+ Node.js
+ Express.js
+ CSS3
+ HTML5
+ MongoDB
+ Tailwind CSS
+ Python
